# Copy this file to .env and fill in your Make.com webhook URLs.
# Add .env to .gitignore so secrets are not committed.
#
# ⚠️  SECURITY NOTE: Variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed in the client
# bundle. For production, replace the direct webhook calls with a backend proxy
# (e.g. a Netlify/Vercel serverless function) and move the URLs server-side.
